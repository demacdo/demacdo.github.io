I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Gibson Lab](https://gibsonlab.io/) at Brigham and Women's Hospital studying machine learning for the gut microbiome. 

I did my PhD in the [Biomedical Simulation Lab](https://bsl.mie.utoronto.ca/) in the Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto.
